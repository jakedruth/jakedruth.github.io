												My Capstone Project, Keeper. Keeper is an educational game that teaches the player about bees and pollination. A lot of effort went into making this game fun to play, both the mechanics and the story.
											</p>
											<p>
												My job on this project was to work on implementing the animations the artist created, iterating on the various systems and managers like saving and loading, creating an editable journal, and finding and fixing bugs. This game was worked on over the course of two semesters as our group's capstone project with a little over 1900 hours of work and effort.

												This game was completed during the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/news/theme-global-game-jam-online-2021">Global Game Jam 2021</a>. This year's theme was "Lost and Found." We decided to implement this theme by creating Lost at Sea, a puzzle pirate adventure game. Your goal is to sail the ocean searching for islands that seem to appear and disappear on a whim! These elusive islands contain a lot of valuable loot! You can land on any island and dig for buried treasure. After disturbing the island enough, Poseidon reclaims his land. Watch Out! There are pirates that want to take your gold! Keep them at bay with your cannons!

												This game was created during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1">Miz Jam 1</a>. There was no theme for this game jam, but instead all participants work with the same <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack">art asset</a> to create a game. Over the course of a week, each team was only alloted 48 hours to work. Due to school and work, I was only able to put in roughly 24 hours.
											</p>
											<p>
												<em>Off The Rails</em> is a top-down shooter with a twist. There are rails that user can hop on and ride around levels and can only get off at designated points. This introduces some puzzle aspects as the player needs to navigate around a maze and alter the path of the rails on the fly.

												This project was created during the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/news/theme-ggj-2020-%E2%80%A6">Global Game Jam 2020.</a> The theme was "Repair", all about fixing stuff. Our team decided to interpret the theme as pairing up things again. (re)Pair is a puzzle game about Noah's ark breaking down and having all of the animals get loose. It is up to the player to re-pair all of the escaped animals, <em>again</em>. This is done by pushing the same breed of animals together, but watch out! Some animals just can't fight their urge to eat smaller prey. Avoid bringing tasty snacks near these animals, like crocodiles and snakes. Other animals just don't want to move. They would much rather wait around until food comes to them than be pushed by the likes of you. You will come across several challenging puzzles and find various pick-ups along the way.

											<p>
												Gridlock Wars was a game I worked on for my AG 131 Final at NHTI in 2014. It was one of my first major games made in XNA. My work included creating most of the player-controller systems and all of the visuals, focusing on the grid and particle effect sytem. The grid is a series of lines connected together following Hooke's Law that reacts to forces generated by every object. If the force is positive, the springs are repeled. If the force is negative, the springs are attracted.
											</p>
											<p>
												Every game object is rendered simple by drawing lines. I created a compainion application that allows building ships and other shapes that can export the lines to an XML file. This file can then be read by the game engine in order to display it in game. The object of the game is to try to survive for as long as possible and getting a highscore. It can support up to 4 players simultaneously, and requires an xbox controller for each player.

												This game Was Created in the Unreal Engine 4. This was our first game in the new engine so it was mostly a learning experience as to how UE4 worked. The concept of the game is that the player has only 2 minutes to beat the final boss, but they are extreamly under powered. However, they can restart the game when ever they want taking back any money they have found. On this project, I focused on the player class and the restarting of the world while keeping abilities and money.

												This project was developed during a 48 hour game jam. It is a rail shooter where the object is to shoot as many targets as you can, and as quickly as possible. Currently, there is only one level with two gun types. I focused mainly on the camera movement, the gun controls, and the art.

											<p>
												This was originally made during the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj14-theme">Global Game Jam 2014</a> during the last 10 hours. The theme was "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." I decided to make a game where depending on which direction you were going, the maze would show different things. Since the game jam, I have added small things to the game, including a level select screen, but no major game concepts have been changed.
											</p>
											<p>
												The screen shot shows the concept of the game. Only one colored wall will be visible at any time, in this case green. All other walls will be invisible while they are still physically there. The object is to navigate the maze and get to the Magenta goal block as quick as possible, with the fewest amounts of keyboard presses, and without dying.
